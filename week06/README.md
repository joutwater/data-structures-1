## AA Meeting Query
Cross Table Query using ```SELECT```,```WHERE```,```BETWEEN```,```ORDER BY``` and using distance calculations based on coordinates. The user can specify a day for the meeting, a window for the meeting to start, an (optional) text based address to order the results by distance.The location information uses the TAMU geolocation system to get the location coordinates.
*The query will work without the location, allowing for anonymity.*
The user is presented with the address (user friendly with additional details such as which avenues it is between), group name and meeting start time.
